Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The vulnerability was that the session id could have been spoofed easily. 
In the secured version the session was set to http only thereby accepting requests from http source only. 
Also sameSite was made true so that only same server was allowed to request data from APIs. 

Spoofing violates Confidentiality from CIA properties.
