- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
In the insecure version it is very difficult to track the mallicious user who is actively doing malicious activities. 

In the secure version we create a log of all the activities whenever the user posts or retrieves 
any messages or simply call an API. IP address along with date and time is logged locally on the server. 

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
We can have access control mechanisms as well as have digital signatures to be sent with the request to the server. 
Have session management in place.
