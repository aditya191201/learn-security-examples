Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

In the insecure version we are directly using the user input from req.params without sanitizing it. 
Without sanitizing any malicious user can inject scripts which can modify our data or change its behaviour. 

In the secure version we sanitize the input and remove any hidden html or javascript embedded in the input. 

Tampering violates Integrity propery of CIA.
